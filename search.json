    "text": "HELLO!!\nI am Sandhya Kanduri!, I’m a graduate student currently pursuing a master’s degree in Data Analytics Engineering at George Mason University. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science Engineering, and throughout my academic journey, I’ve gained my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and problem-solving.\nI have always had a passion for diving deep into data and uncovering the stories behind the numbers. Over the years, I’ve completed several internships, both technical and non-technical, which have broadened my understanding of various domains and enhanced my adaptability. I led two major projects focused on machine learning and data analysis, gaining hands-on experience with practical, real-world data challenges.\nIn addition to my technical background, I’m an active speaker who loves collaborating with others, and I’m known for my strong communication skills. I also had the opportunity to lead a student event club during my undergraduate years, where I organized a wide range of cultural and tech events, bringing together creative minds to make impactful experiences."

    "text": "Redesigned Graphs\n\nBar plot of the highest-paid occupations: This will show the top-paying occupations in descending order, highlighting the one with the highest median wage.\n\n\nGraph useful to compare and contrast wages among the highest paid jobs include health-related jobs such as Psychiatrists, Nurse Anesthetists, Dentists, and Pediatricians and top management jobs including Chief Executives and Human Resources Managers.\nThey seem closer to, or well above, $200,000 for all occupations, which may be considered a high-paying employment.The vertical lines indicate the remuneration for these careers which vary in minor amounts,and this may be indicative of similar levels of remuneration across high-end segments of professions across different regions.\n2.Bar plot of total employment by occupation: This will show the total number of employees in each occupation for better understanding of occupation distribution across the dataset.\n\nEach bar gives the total amount of employees in that occupation. Family Medicine Physicians are the most, with over 3,000, while other occupations like Pediatricians and Dentists fall to around 800 and are much lower, though comparable to each other.\nThe family medicine physician has the highest total rate of employment, which shows that this occupation is in great demand compared to other occupations. They are serving almost 4 times as large as a workforce compared to occupations such as Chief Executives or Obstetricians. Lower Employment for Specialized Occupations: Jobs like Nurse Anesthetists,Obstetricians, and Chief Executives have low total employment because those occupations are specialized, and the number of roles is limited.\n3.Geographical distribution of median wages by area: A map plot (choropleth map) to show median wages across different states or regions. color scale ranges from yellow to blue. Yellow indicates that the median is closer to $200k and blue represents wages over $205k.\n\nBelow is the map where states are colored by the median wages of occupations. Lighter colors indicate low wages, while darker colors indicate higher wages. It also shows that some states, colored in shades of blue and green, include Colorado, Nevada, and New York; this would indicate that the three states’ median wages are higher, closer to and above $205k.Pairs of states, including Wyoming and Alabama, show yellow, indicating lower median wages in the $200k range.\nColorado, California, Nevada, New York, and parts of the Northeast have had higher median wages than other areas. States at a low range include Alabama, Kentucky, Dakotas, etc. Most of the country demonstrates wages relatively similarly within a range from $200,000 to $205,000, which shows that wages do vary, although the range is narrow across most states. This map is a good way for users to comprehend how geography could affect the pay and should prove helpful for anyone looking to relocate in search of greater pay, or in compiling competitive wages state by state.This visualization also shows regional economic disparities, with some states offering much higher wages than others, possibly due to localized demand for specialized occupations.\n4.Scatter plot of total employment vs. median wage: This will help identify any correlation between the size of employment and median wage for different occupations.\n\nA gradient ranging from purple to yellow: yellow for higher wages above $205k and purple for the lower bound closer to $175k. Most of the observations are concentrated between $200k to $210k median wage, while the total employment usually stays below 600. While the count of job employment varies greatly for a few occupations, with numbers reaching up to 1800 employees, their median wages remain relatively related to the low-employment-level wages.\nThis scatter plot will help the user understand the development or otherwise of the association between how many people are employed in certain high-paying jobs and the wages they earn. It would probably yield a useful context to job seekers or professionals in these industries while comparing roles.\nReferences:\n\nHowMuch.net. (2020). The Best-Paying Occupation in Each State.
